the sentences that don't match to each othere then we use some contrast words that show this difference.
But:When you give equall priority to both sentences then use but just like bellow in the examples
exampel:I love you, but I don't marry you.
example:I trust you, but you don't trust me.
example:I tried to find my ring, but I couldn't find it.
