the sentences that don't match to each othere then we use some contrast words that show this difference.
But:When you give equall priority to both sentences then use but just like bellow in the examples
exampel:I love you, but I don't marry you.
example:I trust you, but you don't trust me.
example:I tried to find my ring, but I couldn't find it.

Although:(halankih)
when you give priority to the second cluase then use the word "although"
example:although I was felling sleepy, I went with my friends.
example:although I am single, I am not ready marry yet.
example:although I study online, I have to go to the software house.although I study online, I have to go to the software house.

instead of although we can use though:

example:though I am lazy, I take a bath everyday.
example:though I have taken the medicin, I am not feeling better yet.
example:though He looks tough on the outside, he is very kind on the inside.
