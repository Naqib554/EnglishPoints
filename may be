If he were here, he would be helping us.
(Imaginary situation in the present: He is not here, but if he were, he would be helping us.)

If she won the lottery, she would be traveling the world.
(Imaginary situation in the future: She hasn't won the lottery, but if she did, she would be traveling the world.)

If they had more time, they would be finishing the project.
(Imaginary situation in the present with an implied condition: They don't have more time, but if they did, they would be finishing the project.)

In each of these examples, the structure "Subject + would be + verb-ing + object" is used to describe a situation that is not real or not currently happening. It's used to talk about what someone would be doing or how things would be different if certain conditions were different or met.

Yes, the sentences provided in the previous response belong to specific tenses in English. Let's identify the tenses used in each sentence:

"If he were here, he would be helping us."
Tenses:

If clause (conditional clause): Past subjunctive mood (often used to express unreal or hypothetical situations).
Main clause: Present continuous conditional tense (used to talk about imaginary or hypothetical actions in the present).
"If she won the lottery, she would be traveling the world.
Tenses:
If clause (conditional clause): Simple past tense (used to talk about a past event that is unreal or hypothetical).
Main clause: Present continuous conditional tense (used to talk about imaginary or hypothetical actions in the present).
"If they had more time, they would be finishing the project."
Tenses:
If clause (conditional clause): Past perfect tense (used to talk about an unreal or hypothetical situation in the past).
Main clause: Present continuous conditional tense (used to talk about imaginary or hypothetical actions in the present).
In all three sentences, the conditional "if" clauses express unreal or hypothetical situations, and the main clauses use 
the present continuous conditional tense to describe what would be happening in those unreal or hypothetical situations. 
These structures are essential for expressing possibilities, predictions, or imagined scenarios.
